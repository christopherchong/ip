Used ChatGPT to help with identifying the cause of certain errors, checking if the code that I 
wrote was efficient or if there were room for improvement, and general queries on how to proceed 
when I was stuck on a task or increment.

Tasks:
- Packages: generated a directory tree to outline where classes should be moved when organizing
classes into packages.
- JUnit: generated example test cases to get an idea of how to write test cases.
- JavaDoc: generated example Javadoc comments to get an idea on the syntax and important details
to include in a header comment.
- Personality: modified responses and error messages to include a more bubbly and cheerful personality
